# Cervical screening: Millions missing smear tests

In October 2018 we [reported that three million women across England have not had a smear test for at least three-and-a-half years](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45593583), and that screening rates were at their lowest for two decades. Public Health England said it was "concerned" by the fall.

The data was extracted from Public Health England spreadsheets which used lookup tables. The data powering those tables was not easily accessible, so [an R script](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/cervical-screening/blob/master/extracthiddendata.R) was used to extract that underlying data.
